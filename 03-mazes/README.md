# Solution to programming challenge #3

This week's on [Jamis Buck programming challenges](https://medium.com/@jamis/weekly-programming-challenge-3-932b16ddd957#.mhlsxrtbc): MAZES!

Sadly, I didn't have much time so I had to do it quick and dirty using JavaScript.

## Instructions

Run `npm install`, then load up a node on the command line using the file you want:

```
var execute = require('./maze.js');
execute('maze-normal/maze-normal-004.txt')
```

The output should look like this:
```

DONE!, executed in  14 ms
```

Any advice on my code (or how to live my life ðŸ––) is welcome!
